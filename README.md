# Stacks_in_cppds
 In computer science, a stack is a collection of elements with two main operations: push, which adds an element to the collection, and pop, which removes the most recently added element. Think of it like a stack of platesâ€”you can only add or remove a plate from the top.

Now, in the realm of C++, you can implement stacks using the standard template library (STL). The std::stack container adapter provides a convenient and consistent interface. It's like a wrapper around other container classes, with a default underlying container of std::deque (double-ended queue).

The Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle governs stacks. Imagine a stack of books. The last book you put on the stack is the first one you take off. It's a simple and powerful concept.
